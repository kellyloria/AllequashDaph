# AllequashDaph
Looking at Daphnia infection from Allequash Lake for both the competitive release of zooplankton groups other than D. pulicaria and the environmental/physical effects (lake water clarity, temperature, and nutrients) on infection rates. 

## 1. Competitive release of zooplankton
- File names are "_ZCP" 
- Mainly just time series and GLMs to see some basic correlations between groups
- Want to see if community dynamics explain more variation than environ variation ... 

## 2. Allequash Zooplankton Environmental Effects
- File names are "_Phys"
- Want to see any correlations between phys factors and D. pulicaria infections.
- 2020-06-22 pause to see if there is more available data ... there are a surprising amount of NA's.
